======

This is the source code of the game [Enemy Nations](http://enemynations.com)
without the [content](http://timeoutd.net/EnemyNationsSource.rar).

There is also a [very old binary package](http://timeoutd.net/enemy_nations.iso) available that I actually got working
in windows 7 and probably also in wine, but it requires some fiddling. 
Message me if you need help.

See license.txt for the license.
