# Enemy Nations Historical Timeline

Enemy Nations is a 1997 real-time strategy game created by Windward Studios, a
Colorado-based independent studio led by David Thielen. The project combined a
technically ambitious voxel terrain engine with economic and military
simulation systems that pushed contemporary PC hardware. The notes below
document the game's key milestones, the challenges the team faced bringing it
to market, and the legacy they left for the open-source community.

## Development and Release Milestones

- **1994–1996 – Independent prototyping.** After leaving Microsoft, David
  Thielen founded Windward Studios and self-funded a small team to iterate on
the voxel engine and user-interface concepts that would become Enemy Nations,
ultimately investing over US$500,000 to keep development going during the
publisher search.[1][2]
- **1996 – Publishing deal with Head Games.** Windward signed a contract with
  Head Games Publishing (later acquired by Activision) that promised national
retail distribution but also imposed aggressive milestones and tight cash
flow, leaving the studio dependent on timely royalty payments.[2]
- **March 1997 – Commercial release.** Enemy Nations shipped for Windows 95
after approximately three years of development. Reviewers praised its deep
logistics model and free-form base construction, with outlets such as
*PC Gamer* and *Computer Gaming World* highlighting the scale of the maps and
the AI's ability to contest resources.[1]
- **1998–2002 – Distribution collapse and litigation.** Soon after launch,
  Head Games' sale to Activision disrupted marketing plans, retail orders were
slashed, and promised royalty statements stopped arriving. Windward sued for
breach of contract and in 2002 secured a US$1.9 million jury award plus the
rights to Enemy Nations, effectively ending the commercial dispute.[2][3]
- **March 2005 – Freeware and source release.** With the legal cloud lifted,
  Windward celebrated the game's community by making the full game a free
download and publishing the source code under a custom license, inviting fans
to keep the project alive through mods and ports.[4]
- **2011–present – Community stewardship.** Fans have mirrored the code on
  GitHub, replaced defunct middleware with open alternatives, and modernized
build scripts to keep Enemy Nations compilable on current toolchains, laying
the groundwork for cross-platform experimentation.[5]

## Challenges Faced by the Team

- **Cash-flow strain.** Self-funding most of the production forced Windward to
  accept milestone schedules that prioritized quick retail release over polish,
leaving the team racing to finish while awaiting publisher advances.[2]
- **Retail politics.** The shift from Head Games to Activision removed the
dedicated budget-line marketing Windward expected. The resulting cutback in
store orders meant many potential players never saw Enemy Nations on shelves
and the studio missed critical holiday sales windows.[2]
- **Post-launch support.** Without promised royalties, Windward could not fund
  patches or expansion content, limiting their ability to respond to balance
feedback despite strong critical reception.[2]

## Tribute to the Creators

Enemy Nations exists today because of David Thielen and the Windward Studios
team's commitment to ambitious strategy design in the face of daunting
business setbacks. Their decision to release the code in 2005 empowered fans
to study, preserve, and expand the game. This repository builds directly on
that gift by swapping in open-source middleware and reviving the build
pipeline for new generations of contributors.[4][5]
