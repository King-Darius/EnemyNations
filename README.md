README
======

This is the source code of the game [Enemy Nations](http://enemynations.com)
without the [content](http://timeoutd.net/EnemyNationsSource.rar).

There is also a [very old binary package](http://timeoutd.net/enemy_nations.iso) available that I actually got working
in windows 7 and probably also in wine, but it requires some fiddling. 
Message me if you need help.

See license.txt for the license.

Goals
=====

Well, ultimately to port it to linux and update the graphics and udpade the
weird userinterface to something more usable. 
But step by step:

1. Update to compile with Visual C++ 2010 and remove CD check 
2. Port to Linux
3. Enhance rendering engine and graphics 
4. Enhance userinterface

There is also the [Enemy Nations Revival Project](http://groups.google.com/forum) which seems pretty dead though.
